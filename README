This is a really basic example how django-shop looks with real templates.

Setup instructions are simple:

- Make sure you have django and django-shop installed (i recommend creating a virtualenv for this)

Then:

- Add 'shop_example' to INSTALLED_APPS

or using the shipped sample project:

- cd project && python manage.py syncdb && python manage.py runserver
